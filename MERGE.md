# Merge Instructions for PDF RAG System Feature

This document provides instructions for merging the `feature-pdf-rag-system` branch back to the main branch using both GitHub web interface and GitHub CLI.

## Feature Summary

This feature adds a complete PDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to the application:

### Backend Changes
- **Enhanced API endpoints** in `/api/app.py`:
  - `POST /api/upload-pdf` - Upload and process PDF files
  - `POST /api/rag-chat` - Chat with uploaded PDF using RAG
  - `GET /api/pdf-status` - Check PDF upload status
- **New dependencies** in `/api/requirements.txt`:
  - PyPDF2 for PDF processing
  - python-dotenv for environment variables
  - numpy for vector operations
- **RAG system integration** using the `aimakerspace` library:
  - PDF text extraction and chunking
  - Vector database for semantic search
  - OpenAI embeddings and chat completion

### Frontend Changes
- **Complete React application** in `/frontend/`:
  - Modern, responsive UI with drag-and-drop PDF upload
  - Real-time chat interface with streaming responses
  - API key management
  - PDF status indicators
- **New dependencies** in `/frontend/package.json`:
  - React 18 with Vite build system
  - Axios for API communication
  - Lucide React for icons

# gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Local Branch
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete the local feature branch
git branch -d feature-pdf-rag-system

# Clean up any remote tracking references
git remote prune origin
```

## Post-Merge Verification

After merging, verify the changes:

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Application
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Start chatting with the PDF

## Rollback Instructions (if needed)

If issues arise after merging:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert -m 1 [merge-commit-hash]

# Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Selective Rollback
```bash
# Revert specific files
git checkout HEAD~1 -- api/app.py
git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/
```

## Notes
